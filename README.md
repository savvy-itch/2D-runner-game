## About
This is a simple project that I've built for fun to test my skills in the areas I don't normally work in. The stack is vanilla by design, I wanted to use the most basic tools and build everything from the ground up. In the game player must jump the obstacles. The game is fully responsive and incorporates sound effects for better experience.

## Controls:
- Start (`Enter`, `Spacebar`)
- Jump (`Spacebar`, `ArrowUp`)
